###Enable Apache on Mac OS X

```
apachectl start
```

Verify It works! by accessing [http://localhost](http://localhost)

###Enable PHP for Apache

First, make a backup of the default Apache configuration. This is good practice and serves as a comparison against future versions of Mac OS X.

```
cd /etc/apache2/ 
cp httpd.conf httpd.conf.bak
```
Now edit the Apache configuration. Feel free to use TextEdit if you are not familiar with vi.

```
vi httpd.conf
```
**Uncomment the following line (remove #):**

```
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
```
###Restart Apache:

```
apachectl restart
```

You can verify PHP is enabled by creating a phpinfo() page in your DocumentRoot.

The default DocumentRoot for Mac OS X Yosemite is /Library/WebServer/Documents. You can verify this from your Apache configuration.

```
grep DocumentRoot httpd.conf
```
Now create the phpinfo() page in your DocumentRoot:

```
echo '<?php phpinfo();' > /Library/WebServer/Documents/phpinfo.php
```
Verify PHP by accessing [http://localhost/phpinfo.php](http://localhost/phpinfo.php)

###Install MySQL on Mac OS X


*Note: If you are upgrading MySQL you should skip this section and instead read this.*

* Download the MySQL DMG for Mac OS X, url [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
* Install MySQL

The README suggests creating aliases for mysql and mysqladmin. However there are other commands that are helpful such as mysqldump. Instead, I updated my path to include /usr/local/mysql/bin.

```
export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH
```
*Note: You will need to open a new Terminal window or run the command above for your path to update.*

I also run mysql_secure_installation. While this isn’t necessary, it’s good practice.

###Connect PHP and MySQL

You need to ensure PHP and MySQL can communicate with one another. There are several options to do so. I do the following:

```
cd /var 
mkdir mysql
cd mysql
ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock mysql.sock
```
###Config vitual path for apache

```
DocumentRoot "/Users/~/works/webserver"
<Directory "/Users/ray/works/webserver">
    ...
</Directory>
<IfModule alias_module>
    Alias /phpmyadmin /Users/~/works/webserver/phpMyAdmin-4.5.4.1-all-languages
    Alias /web /Users/~/works/webserver/wordpress
</IfModule>
```
Then, Then, you can access the sub-website separately through [http://localhost/web](http://localhost/web), [http://loclocalhost/webalhost/phpmyadmin](http://phpmyadmin)
